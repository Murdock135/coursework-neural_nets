\section{Conclusions and future work}

%System 1
The aim was not to attain high classification performance but rather to see the system in action. 

%System2
Disregarded output classes sometimes, which benefitted performance.
The merit of a classifier based on fuzzy sets lies within the interplay of the rules, membership functions and domain knowledge. The domain knowledge 

%system 3
The systems 1 and 2 had 3 fuzzy subsets and with the the better rule bases in system 3, a performance.

Thus, partitioning the overlapped region by having more subsets 
%
number and shape of fuzzy subsets over output domain could've been changed
